1.. create a stack 
2   for each character 't' in the input 
{
    if('t' is an operand)
        op t;

    else if('t' is an paranthesis)
    {
        pop and output 't' until left paranthesis occur (but not print left and right paranthesis)
    }

    else // "t" is an operator or left paranthesis
    pop and output tokens until one of the lower priorty than 't' is encountered of left paranthesis is encountered or 
    stack is empty;
}

3.. pop and output all the tokens until the stack is empty;






// a*(b+c)
   ttttttt
